# Stage-4

Comment:Regarding the files submitted, it is not completed yet (which is in compliance with the specification of each stage until the final stage), for instance, the project is meant to examine and compare the overfitting rate of three different models. the models were 1) Regular CNN model, 2) CNN model with Dropout Regularized techniques, and 3) CNN with Data Augmentation techniques. it is to be noted that partial results for implementation of two of the models were present in the report and files submitted for this stage (only Regular CNN and CNN with Dropout). Regarding the data set we are using, we had an initial discussion with Dr. Cao and she gives go-ahead data that we have been working on before now (since we will be able to implement some of the techniques within the scope of Machine learning in class ).
